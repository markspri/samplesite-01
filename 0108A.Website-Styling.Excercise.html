    <p>Springtime in <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/visit/parks/richmond-park">Richmond Park</a> is a beautiful time. Even though
      it can be chilly at times, it is nice to walk my dog Bacon. This site includes some pictures I have taken on
      these walks. </p>
    <p>Sometimes we walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it to the woods. Richmond Park also has some
      beautiful lakes and ponds.</p>
